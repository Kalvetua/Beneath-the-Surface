# Beneath the Surface

This game was created by me and my project partner in Python through the use of the Pygame-ce module. We named it "Beneath the Surface" and it was built from the base up- that is to say, from scratch.
The motivation behind this project was to showcase our programming skills in our programming class as a sort of final school project.

Only the code has been uploaded to this repository, meaning that it does not contain the map nor the assets that were created/used. Instead, however, there is a video below that showcases part of the project. ^^

Note: the video has no audio.
